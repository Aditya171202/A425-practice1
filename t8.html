    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime">
        Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ[a]; derived from a shortening of English animation) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] However, anime, in Japan and in Japanese, describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that are sometimes labelled as anime.
