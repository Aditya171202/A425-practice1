Founded in 1992 by Argentine-Italian engineer and entrepreneur Horacio Pagani, the company is headquartered in San Cesario sul Panaro, near Modena, Italy, a region renowned for its automotive excellence.</div>
    <div class="box" id="box2">Pagani is recognized for its meticulous craftsmanship, cutting-edge aerodynamics, and engineering innovation, blending art and performance in every vehicle. The brand gained global recognition with its debut model, the Pagani Zonda, followed by the critically acclaimed Pagani Huayra and the latest Pagani Utopia.</div>
    <div class="box" id="box3">n 1991, Pagani established Modena Design to meet the increasing demand for his design, engineering, and prototyping services. In 1992, he began construction of a Fangio F1 prototype, and by 1993, the car was being tested at the Dallara wind tunnel with positive results. In 1994, Mercedes-Benz agreed to supply Pagani with V12 engines. The cost of these cars are at a total of 2.3 million dollars.</div>
    <div class="box" id="box4">The final car was named the Zonda C12, the first of the Zonda line (the Fangio F1 name was dropped out of respect for Fangio, who died in 1995). It was first presented at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show.</div>
