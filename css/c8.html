    <div class="box">Naruto and Sasuke begin fighting, first with taijutsu. Sasuke attacks with fireballs, which Naruto dodges. Naruto creates clones, which attack with Rasengan. Using the Rinnegan, Sasuke pulls Naruto and his clones toward himself, and skewers them with black flames. The real Naruto blocks it with chakra arms, and attacks Sasuke from above with more arms. Entering Six Paths Sage Mode, Naruto continues attacking with chakra arms. Sasuke sends another fireball his way, which Naruto blocks. Sasuke teleports behind Naruto, and sends him back with Chidori. Sasuke begins firing Susanoo arrows, which Naruto blocks with his Truth-Seeking Balls. Sasuke switches to a Complete Body Susanoo, and Naruto enters Tailed Beast Mode just in time to parry Sasuke's attack, fist-bumping him in the process. The two see each other's loneliness as children. Sasuke has Susanoo blow fireballs at Naruto, who dodges them, blocks Susanoo's swords with Kurama's tails, and tosses Susanoo down with them.
